# Create a VMware ESXi 6+ bootable El Capitan Install .ISO

A basic script to create an .ISO from the 'Install El Capitan' installation App - which is required to use this script - so that it can be used on VMware ESXi servers as a boot/installation medium.

ESXi requires Unlocker 2.0.8 to be installed for this to work.

# Usage

Simply run the script anywhere and watch/wait/make a cup of tea -- eventually an iso will appear on your desktop, ready for an ESXi datastore.

# To-Do

Figure out a better way to present user feedback because I am terrible at shell scripting

# Thanks

For the various folks on various forums that made the bits and pieces of this script. Had to do a fair amount of mixing and matching to get it to work successfully.

p.s. - script needs to be run under sudo.
